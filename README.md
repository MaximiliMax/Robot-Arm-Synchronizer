Project Purpose: Translate human arm motion to a robot arm
University MTE 100 - MTE 121 Course Project

This project was made possible by the works of Xander Soldaat at Bot Bench which can be found in the link below:
https://github.com/botbench/robotcdriversuite


This project aimed to create a device that allowed the operation of a robot arm using the natural movements of a human arm. The 3 degrees of freedom arm is controlled by unique wearable sensors.

*Note it was pretty cool controlling the robot, at times it really felt like my arm was one with the robot arm ðŸ˜…



Although the project met the requirements and the demo was really fun, I wish we spent more time recording the projects functionality.
